# MOO_Thesis_Work
In this repository is the entirety of my code to create my Master's Thesis for the Operational Oceanography program at the Department of Marine and Coast Sciences at Rutger University.

This is more of an archive then a guided source for where to find what in this repository. But, I will try to do what I can.

Code for:

Creating 10 year averaged divergence + speed contour maps can be found in Divergence_Plots/10yr/total/all_year_averages.ipynb
Creating 10 year averaged U + V variance can be found in Divergence_Plots/10yr/total/10yr_t_var.ipynb
Creating 10 year averaged monthly figures can be found in Divergence_Plots/10yr/months
Creating 10 year averaged seasonal figures can be found in Divergence_Plots/10yr/seasons

Creating yearly divergence figures can be found in Divergence_Plots/[respective year]

Autocorrelation analysis code can be found in Divergence_Plots/autocorrelation
